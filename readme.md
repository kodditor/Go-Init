# Go Rest API

Here's my first Golang REST API, inplemented using the GIN web framework!

Had an interesting time looking into Go's statically typed syntax, and a basic implementation of an API, giving me some insight into the sheer performace of Gin. 

Compiling to binary also seems to help a lot!


## To run:
```
    go get .
    go run . 
```

###### Speaking as a JS dev, this is mindblowing.
